// TODO setup standard actuator/output structure so nodes can also do something
// improve readsensors() function, maybe relocate earlier in code to make it easier to find, or put in seperate file?
// make readsensors a library, each Sensor needs constructor, 
// create mqtt functions in this library
// how to do an update all function? or should that be individual calls in main program
